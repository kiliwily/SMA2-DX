# Changelog

## Changes
- The highscores on the title screen start at 0.
- Removed a button combo showing a build date at the begin of the intro
- The game saves which save data was saved last

- The status of the two intro cutscenes (color palette, sprite set, yoshi coin) now change depending on what is unlocked inthe last used save data
- Checkpoints get reset when you save & quit the game to make collecting yoshi coins easier
- Save and choosing back to return to the overworld can be used in Yoshis House and Top Secert Area at any time
- The save promt no longer appears after beating a ghost house, the ghost ship or a level in the special world because you can save at any time by pressing start
- Wrap around (pressing up while on the top entry in a menu puts the cursor to the bottom entry and vice versa) has been added on several menus that didn't have it before
- Mushrooms no longer overwrite flowers and feathers in the item inventory
- A sprite that was carried over the goal no longer gets changed into a red mushroom if Mario/Luigi is already big and the inventory is not empty. It gets changed to a 1up mushroom instead.
- Mario/Luigi get 100p for collecting a regular coin (like in virtually every other Mario game). Coins from a coin block also give 100p each.
- Several sprites (red mushroom, flower, feather, star, p-ballon, etc.) get changed to a coin when they're on screen while Mario/Luigi enters the goal (inspired by SMA4/SMB3). This does not happen to items in the inventory.
- Yoshi now stays in Lakitus cloud even when Mario/Luigi unmounts him.
- Removed the time limit in Top Secret Area
- Yoshi now swallows null sprites immediately, because he is not able to spite them out in SMA2 anyway
- ?-Block with yoshi inside and star blocks respawn after resetting the area (coin counter for star block still gets reseted after getting a 1up out of it).

- The background in Forest Secret now moves slower
- The smasher in several fortresses are behind other sprites (like in the SNES version)
- Line guided Fuzzy can be killed and eaten by Yoshi like the other Fuzzys that move around blocks.
- The reward chain when enemies are on the screen while touching the goal now starts at 1000p and gets increased by 1 step at a tim instead of starting at 100p and getting increased by 2 steps at a time (inspred by SMA4/SMB3)
- The reward chain when killing multiple enemies with a shell or a star or stomping on multiple enemies in a row now caps at 5ups instead of 1ups
- The reward chain when collecting silver coins now caps at 5ups instead of 3ups
- The reward for collecting more than 5 Yoshi coins in a level caps at 5ups instead of 1ups
- Ups get added much faster to the counter
- When Mario/Luigi touches a checkpoint while being at least big and the inventory is empty, a mushroom gets in the inventory
- The speed of an item that a sprite gets changed to when carrying it through the goal was reduced to prevent it from going offscreen and despwning
